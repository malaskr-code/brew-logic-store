name: Payment currency compatibility
description: Check the connected payment account's actual presentment currencies, not only currency precision.

Verify the payment account's supported charge currencies before assuming the
store's display currency can be used for checkout. Ask the user before changing
the charge currency; a currency switcher is not permission to change settlement
or checkout behavior.

For Brew Logic, keep catalog/display prices in KWD and use USD for **Stripe test
checkout only**, with the exact server-calculated USD total shown for confirmation
before redirecting to Stripe.

**Why:** The user explicitly approved USD test checkout after the connected
Stripe account rejected KWD.

**How to apply:** Preserve that visible confirmation and currency distinction.
Do not enable live payments or change the charge currency without new approval.

**Why:** Stripe accepted a valid test key but rejected KWD when creating a price.
Correct three-decimal amount handling alone did not make KWD available.

**How to apply:** Check current provider capabilities and actual API responses.
Do not assume adding a bank account will enable a currency, and do not silently
fall back to USD when the storefront promises KWD charges.
